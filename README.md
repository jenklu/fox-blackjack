# Fox Blackjack

A silly little blackjack game. I made this mostly to mess around with Cursor/Claude 3.7 after being inspired by @levelsio's flight simulator.

It was shockingly easy to set up! https://x.com/jenklu12/status/1894643353121128883

Possible improvements:

- More realistic dealer sprite
- Display stacks of chips
- Convert to TypeScript
- Allow different starting bets
